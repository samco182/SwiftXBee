# ATCommandExample

A simple example of how to use AT Command and AT Command Response API Frames. XBee (ZigBee Series 2) radios must be configured in API mode and **AP mode set to 2 (escape bytes)**.

:warning: For a complete list of available AT Commands, please refer to the [XBee's datasheet](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/pdfs/90002002.pdf).

All the AT Commands that can be configured/queried with **SwiftyXBee** can be configured/queried using the [XCTU tool](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001526/tasks/t_download_and_install_xctu.htm) as well.
